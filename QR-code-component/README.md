## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- min() function to make it fully responsive

### What I learned

I have learned how to use the min() function to make responsive component without media queries

```css
img {
  border-radius: 27px;
  padding: min(15px, 5vw);
  max-width: min(290px, 85vw);
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/kevinpowell) - helped me a lot to understand how flexbox / grid works
